# CSS Calc() Function Errors
This repository demonstrates common errors encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS and provides solutions to fix them.

**Problem:** The `calc()` function is a powerful tool for dynamic calculations, but errors in its usage can lead to unexpected layout behavior.  These errors often stem from:

* **Nested calculations:** Improperly nested `calc()` expressions can yield incorrect results.
* **Unit mismatches:** Mixing units (e.g., `px` and `em`) without proper conversion causes calculation errors.
* **Operator precedence:** Incorrect order of operations due to missing parentheses leads to wrong calculations.

**Solution:**  The `bugSolution.css` file demonstrates how to correct these errors by carefully structuring `calc()` expressions, ensuring unit consistency, and using parentheses to enforce the intended order of operations.
