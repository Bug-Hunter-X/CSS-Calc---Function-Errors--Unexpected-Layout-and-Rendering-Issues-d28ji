The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if used incorrectly, particularly when dealing with nested calculations or unit mismatches. For example, using a percentage within a `calc()` expression without considering the context of the parent element can cause unpredictable layout behavior.  Another common issue is forgetting operator precedence within complex `calc()` expressions, leading to incorrect calculations.  Finally, using incompatible units (e.g., mixing `px` and `em` without proper conversion) can also lead to unexpected layout.
